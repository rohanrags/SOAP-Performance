# SOAP-Performance
Analyzing SOAP performance in web services

Abstract— Web Services provides flexibility and interconnection between different systems, the communication in Web Services uses Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) a simple, robust, and extensible protocol that is the most widely used for communication protocol in the Web services model. SOAP message that is being sent to the client needs to be secured from the attackers over the open internet and should also make sure that the response time is minimal. In this paper, the SOAP message is encrypted whole or selective portion using AES (Advanced Encryption Scheme) encryption technique. The SAX parser is used to reduce the memory consumption and execution time for parsing SOAP request, response documents. To optimize the SOAP performance, response time is analyzed for both complete and selective encrypted soap document and results are found satisfactory for selective encryption technique.
